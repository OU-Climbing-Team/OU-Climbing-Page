								<h2> Joining </h2>
								<p>
									Any OU student can join regardless of experience or athleticism.
									Our recruitment is usually during the second week of each semester, we are also at the club fair.
									<br> Our fee varies from semester to semester (ask us in our GroupMe).
								</p>

								<h2> Practices (Managed by our team Capitan)</h2>
								<p>
									We hold practices on most Tuesdays and Thursdays from 19:00 to 21:00.
									<br>They are an amazing way to meet new people and improve climbing skills.
									The exercises usually follow the competition season (excluding speed), though our home gym mainly focuses on bouldering.
								</p>

								<h2> Trips </h2>
								<p>
									No crash pad or quickdraws? No problem. Our trips vary from outdoor climbing in the Wichitas
									to trips down to other Texas climbing gyms. They happen quite often and are organized in our groupme.

							<li>
								Can I join without climbing experience?
								<br> Yes! We have new people all the time and love to get people into the sport.
							</li>

							<li>
								What is bouldering and sport climbing?
								<br>
								Bouldering typically is on short walls climbing without a rope, where you fall on a large mat.
								Sport climbing involves harnesses, high walls, and ropes.
								Both are a subset of climbing.
							</li>

							<li>
								Do I need my own equipment?
								<br> Our home gym provides all the needed equipment, though for outdoor trips you will need at the very least climbing shoes.
